			<h1 class="text-italic"> Hello, I am Kassandra, a Canadian first year student at ESSEC. Welcome to my profile. </h1>
			<p>
				Excellence, engagement and energy. Three words that have transcended my professional and personal development from my early youth growing up in Canada. I am down to earth, passionate, energetic, and engaged. I want to make a difference in every environment I am in - to make a difference in my community, in my surroundings and I know this can only be done through hard work, resilience and commitment - something I am ready to bring to any of my upcoming endeavours.

			<h2> Work experience üè¢ </h2>
			<p>
				Throughout my academic journey, I've been fortunate to collaborate with several prominent brands and companies, each experience contributing significantly to my personal and professional growth. One of the most enriching experiences I had was working with the Coco Market team in Toronto. This opportunity allowed me to immerse myself in the fast-paced world of marketing and gain invaluable insights into consumer behavior, brand strategy, and market trends. In addition to working with established brands, I also ventured into entrepreneurship by launching my very own cookie business and brand. This endeavor was not only a testament to my creativity and innovation but also a demonstration of my entrepreneurial spirit and drive. Managing a business taught me the importance of strategic planning, effective communication, and adaptability as I navigated the challenges and opportunities of the competitive food industry.

			<h2> My hobbies </h2>
			<p>
				With my free time, I try to expand my horizons through a myriad of activites. For example, I love to read, bake, do pilates, workout with friends and walk around new cities exploring. I am a very curious person and love to expand my world perspectives and discover new things. One of the many things studying aborad has given me is the chance to explore new cultures first hand from other international students. This exposure has helped me better adapt to new environments and have imporved my interpersonal skills which will help me in my future career and life. Breaking down cultural barriers, language barriers, fostering meaningful connections and build lifelong friendships with individuals from diverse cultural and social backrounds is something I will cherish for a lifetime.

			<h2> My projects - upcoming work üòé </h2>
			<p>
				I am an incoming intern at Burgundy Asset Management in Toronto for this summer! While I am not quite sure what exactly I want to dedict my life too, I have a role in Client Relations this summer and am super excited to start this new path of my career. In my past jobs, my favorite part has been talking to people and building relationships with them. I always loved chatting with regular customers and now realise I can make a career out of it. Moreover, I have been trying to figure out how I can turn my hobbies into projects. So I have decided to try to write book reviews every few books I read to continue to develop my writting skills. Although I am doing nothing with my reviews at the moment, I hope to one day publish them somewhere.

			<h2> Passions üòä</h2>
			<p>
				What are your passions? A question that has often haunted me throughout my adolescent and now young adult years. For now, at nineteen, this is what I can say. One of my life passions is to be devote to a continual  self development to push myself to be the best version of myself. Wether that be the best daughter, friend, girlfriend and, hopefully, one day a mother, I am committed to personal growth, learning, and evolving in order to nurture meaningful relationships and make a positive impact on the lives of those around me. One thing I love is my cat Grey Goose. There is a picture of him down below. He is the thing I miss the most from Canada.
